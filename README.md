# DL_Syn2Trackers
 Convert the 2D Trackers from SynthEyes to Nuke

As a personal project, I've developed another tool to convert the Tracking Data from SynthEyes to Nuke.

At this time, we don't need to have a Camera Solve, just export your 2D Trackers as "All Tracker Paths" from SynthEyes, and import it on Nuke using this Toolset.

You don't need to install it, just drag and drop on your Nuke (or save it as a Toolset). At the moment, is working in Nuke 12, 13, Indie and Non-Commercial.

Special thanks to Murilo Augusto to helped me manipulate the lists better on Python. Also, thanks to Henrique Reginato, Gustavo Shrank and Magno Borgo to try the tool as well.

I hope you enjoy!
